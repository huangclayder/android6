Subject: [PATCH 320/505] ENGR00210831 - EPDC fb unit test: Collision Test
 fixed by adding delay

EPDC Collision Test (#13) was failing because there was not sufficient
delay between the two updates that should be colliding.  Adding a delay
of 400ms results in the collision being consistently reported.
