Subject: [PATCH 091/602] ENGR00232023 sabresd: set the default lcd density to
 160dpi

As the ipu fb driver has the ability to export
the screen panel width/height size to userspace.
The LVDS we used is actually 128dpi, calculated
by the gralloc framebuffer settings. But
this density breaks the display quality on
our LVDS. So keep the 160dpi still makes sense.
