Subject: [PATCH 154/602] ENGR00241208 Enlarge the navigation bar height

Enlarge the navigation bar height size to 55dp.
As we have set the dpi to 140, framework will
decrease the height size by 55dpx140/160 which
is actually 48px. Then the total usable window size
of each application is 1024x720. Under this
configuration, the one pixel highlight line below
the statusbar has gone.
This should be a bug in phone window policy when
Window manager decide which region can be used by
apps when status bar visiable.

We just put a workaround here.
