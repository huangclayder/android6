Subject: [PATCH 094/602] ENGR00232414 Bootanimation be started 10s after
 console started

Surfacefinger will guarantee caller the permission if its pid is AID_GRAPHICS.
For those caller's pid not AID_GRAPHICS, Surfaceflinger will count on
ServiceManager's permission service to check the permission. ServiceManager
will keep waiting for a valid permission service registered. Permission
Service will be registered in ActivityManager's creation, which is around
10s after console started.
