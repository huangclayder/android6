Subject: [PATCH] ENGR00318895-2 mtd: spi-nor: fix the wrong dummy value

For the DDR Quad read, the dummy cycles maybe 3 or 6 which is less then 8.
The dummy cycles is actually 8 for SPI fast/dual/quad read.

This patch makes preparations for the DDR quad read, it fixes the wrong dummy
value for both the spi-nor.c and m25p80.c.
